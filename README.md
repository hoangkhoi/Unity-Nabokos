This is the first game I made in Unity, and I left it rotten in the dust, So I hereby 0make all code public for everyone to use and learn from. I hope this code would help you in some way.

also see 'Excel-sokoban' in my github projects

## How to (help and) open/edit this project?
1) Make sure you have __Unity__ and some sort of editor like __Visual Studio__ installed
2) Clone (Download) the whole project, I recommend a program like __GitHub desktop__ if you want to help
3) Open Unity and do 'File-Open project' Select the project folder and open the project (This will take a long time if it's the first time)
4) Don't forget to open the game scene; In your project window under /Assets/_Scenes/Game
