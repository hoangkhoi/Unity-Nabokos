Sokoban solver robot to check min steps?

Define animation speed, and buffer length in PlayGame, they will be overwritten on start so 1,1 is fine. But then the settingsfile is missing it kinda still work.
create the settings file on boot????? check if unity exports this 
make it so it saves; time spend, amount of steps, level, and data stamp so I can later see what levels are harder to finish. This to make a better level curve

Update textures
Make a way to cancel move when a button is pressed 	/	cancel moves when typing (an such)
Add name and icon and more info stuff of the game
Gamemode, do steps and press play to play the allv
Disable the 'screen off' mode
when animation done and button still pressed continue moving?
Lopende band/teleporter. Stop auto ding na x seconds om loops te voorkomen
Let the game not work when device is locked/Diable game on lockscreen

Opties menu, Rotation off when off/ always off/ always on
	Opties menu, animation speed.
	Opties menu, Secet value max steps in memory
Opties menu, Block screen edges (helps to use nav buttons)\
Opties menu, Show steps taken on overlay
Opties menu, Always shows status bar
